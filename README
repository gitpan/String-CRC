This is a MacPerl build of String::CRC.  You need a recent MacPerl
(such as MacPerl 5.2.0r4, the latest as of this build) and either
the PPC MacPerl or the CFM68K MacPerl (because dynamic loading
is not avialable in the non-CFM 68K MacPerl).

You might also need to run autosplit:

    #!perl -w
    use AutoSplit;
    $dir = "$ENV{MACPERL}site_perl";
    autosplit("$dir:String:CRC.pm","$dir:auto",0,1,1);

Also recommended are Paul Schinder's Fixed Library Routines,
available from his web site:

    http://pobox.com/~schinder/MacPerl.html

This stuff is always available on CPAN and on pudge.net.

    http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/CNANDOR/

CHANGES:

CRC.xs was changed slightly on line 142.

    int data_len;

was changed to:

    U32 data_len;

Thanks to Arved Sandstrom for that.  Hopefully, it will still work
properly; it did pass all tests.
