=head1 NAME

CRC - Perl interface cyclic redundency check generation

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use String::CRC;
    
    ($crc_low, $crc_high) = crc("some string", 64);
    $crc_binary = crc("some string", 64);
    ($crc_low, $crc_high) = unpack("LL", $crc_binary);
    ($crc_small) = crc("some string", 32);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<CRC> module calculates CRC of various lenghts.  The default
CRC length is 32 bits.  

CRCs of 32 bits and smaller will be returned as an integer.

CRCs that are larger than 32 bits will be returned as two integers
if called in list context and as a packed binary string if called
in scalar context.
